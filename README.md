## A short message: :scroll:
Happy birthday to the one who knows the constellations by heart in my sky! It's hard to believe it's been seven years since our paths crossed, seven years of shared secrets, belly laughs that hurt our sides, and adventures that still make us giddy when we reminisce. You've seen me at my messy, vulnerable worst, yet celebrated my wildest dreams with fiercer pride than anyone else. You're not just my best friend, you're the sister I chose, the laughter in my darkest hours, and the reason I believe in the magic of true friendship.

Today, as you blow out the candles, may each wish light a spark of joy in your life. May the coming year be filled with sunshine and stardust, with moments that leave you breathless and dreams coming true with the sweetest surprise. Thank you for being the anchor in my storms, the sunshine after the rain, and the one constant melody in the soundtrack of my life.

Here's to seven years of memories woven into gold thread, and a million more chapters yet to write. Happy birthday, my dearest friend. Cheers to you, because the world is a brighter, braver place with you in it. ❤️

P.S. Get ready for the craziest birthday surprise yet! This year, we're painting the town with our laughter, and making memories that will echo through the ages. ✨
